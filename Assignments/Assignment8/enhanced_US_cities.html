(Peter Cziborra/Reuters) How COVID-19 could change the way cities look and operate While some cities have eased lockdown restrictions, physical distancing measures that health officials say are crucial to halting the spread of COVID-19 will likely be with us for months, if not longer. They are already having an effect on activity levels and the flow of cities, writes CBC's Andre Mayer, while planners, architects and designers are seeing changes both in Canada and around the world that could become permanent. Every major calamity, from the 19th-century cholera outbreaks to the 2013 floods in Calgary, has provided valuable lessons in better city-building, said John Brown, dean of the school of architecture, planning and landscape at the University of Calgary. But COVID-19 poses a unique challenge. Ensuring people have access to transit, shopping amenities and fresh air, all while maintaining a two-metre distance, is difficult in high-density areas. As a result of our collective self-isolation, there are fewer cars on the road. At the same time, people are seeking respite outdoors by walking. But it is increasingly challenging to maintain a respectful distance on sidewalks without veering into traffic. Some municipalities are taking bold action to address this. Last week, the Italian city of Milan announced a plan to transform 35 kilometres of streets to expand cycling and walking space. In reducing car capacity, it will have the dual effect of providing a safe outlet for walkers and reducing air pollution. Berlin, Budapest and Mexico City are just some of the cities proposing similar measures. Public transit is also a crucial element of any cityscape, as many people can't rely on a car to get around. Most cities are reporting a drop in public transit use during the pandemic, and it's likely to remain lower than usual in the short term, said Ahsan Habib, director of the school of planning at Dalhousie University. During the pandemic, U.S. cities such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago">Chicago</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver">Denver</a> have made several adjustments to their transit systems, including suspending fares and allowing rear-door boarding. Habib said ultimately, cities must invest in ways to make buses and streetcars less prone to crowding. The pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of letting a large part of the labour force work from home. While not everyone can telecommute, enough people are able to do so that it could reduce demand for physical offices, which could in turn affect the proliferation of highrise buildings. Brown, who also runs a Calgary-based architecture firm called Housebrand, said telecommuting may also have an impact on the layout of homes, as residents seek to carve out discrete corners in even the tiniest condo suite to have a private Zoom meeting.

Howe says Canada is officially in a recession that's been caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the C.D. Howe Institute's Business Cycle Council declared today. The council, which monitors recessions and recoveries in Canada, said the economy peaked in February, just before drastic measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus were implemented across the country. There are no hard and fast rules for declaring a recession, although one rule of thumb used by economists is that an economy is probably in one if it has shrunk for two three-month periods in a row. The council rejects the "two quarters" rule and instead defines a recession as a "pronounced, persistent and pervasive decline in aggregate economic activity" based largely on GDP and the job market. The COVID-19 pandemic is still less than two months old in Canada, but the council said that the slowdown is already so swift and deep that it's safe to declare a recession already. In the council's view, this is the first recession Canada has seen since the financial crisis that began in 2008 — and the data suggests this one is on track to be quite a bit worse than that one. While the decline in March was record-setting, economists expect the data for April will show an even bigger drop, with the measures taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus in place for the entire month.

Lawn care and landscaping services, garden centres and nurseries with curbside pickup, community gardens, automatic and self-serve car washes, auto dealers, and some construction projects will be allowed to open on Monday, with specific rules around how they can operate. "Today's news shows us if we stay the course, if we stay vigilant and take the measured approach, we can keep moving in the right direction," Premier Doug Ford said at a news briefing. In Alberta, meanwhile, Premier Jason Kenney detailed his government's plan for a multi-stage relaunch that will depend on the province's continued ability to control the spread of the coronavirus and curb the number of COVID-19 patients who need hospital care. The first step in Alberta's plan to reopen its economy will emphasize outdoor activities, with golf courses to open Saturday, followed by shops, bars and restaurants by mid-May. Parts of the gradual relaunch plan, which Kenney announced Thursday, will begin Monday with the resumption of some non-urgent surgeries and office reopenings for dentists, physiotherapists and other professionals. Schools will remain closed until the end of the academic year, with instruction continuing online, but Kenney said the province is in discussions with school boards "about allowing some limited reopening on a trial basis" for summer classes and specialized programs.

But Tim Strauss said he knows that one of the biggest tasks involved in bringing air travel back to life after pandemic restrictions lift will be convincing the public it's safe to fly. The airline industry has been hammered by the pandemic. Some Canadian airlines have stopped flying entirely while others, including Air Canada, have scaled back more than 90 per cent because of the dramatic drop in demand. At a virtual Canadian Club Toronto event today, executives at several major airlines talked about what the North American airline industry could look like post-pandemic. Air Canada, Sunwing and American Airlines said corporate conversations about post-pandemic operations are focused on making sure planes are kept clean. Some airlines are changing how often they sanitize their planes and are even considering changes to how air is circulated in passenger cabins. Transport Canada has made it mandatory for all passengers to wear masks while on board and in airports when they cannot physically distance two metres from others. While Air Canada predicts better times for the industry by Christmas, airline analyst Helane Becker points out that other countries will need to lift their pandemic restrictions and reopen their economies first in order to convince people to travel. "We need to get all these governments on the same page to kind of open things up. Everyone wants it to be done safely because no one wants the recurrence of cases," Becker said Read more about the pandemic's impact on air travel   THE SCIENCE Is Canada looking into using remdesivir? CBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions about the COVID-19 pandemic, including this one. If you have a question of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca. As for the issue at hand: The U.S. is fast-tracking approval of the antiviral drug remdesivir to help treat COVID-19. Top U.S. health official Dr. Anthony Fauci said it has a "clear cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery," after favourable results of a clinical trial. Remdesivir, which impairs the coronavirus's ability to replicate, was initially used to treat Ebola, but is not officially approved for use in Canada. Yet, some hospitals are getting access to it through "individual compassionate use." What does this mean? Health Canada has a program that allows particular, unapproved drugs to be used in unique cases. Health Canada said the maker of remdesivir, Gilead, is transitioning to this "provision of emergency access" but can no longer accept more requests because of "an overwhelming demand." In an email to CBC News, Gilead said it is ramping up production but did not specify how much remdesivir would be sent to Canada. AND FINALLY... Alberta artist offers daily, online painting class for kids Everly-Ann Toma, left, and Grace Horsfall Couldwell are among the children participating in Paint with MJ, a daily free art lesson on Facebook with Alberta artist MJ Stead. (Left, Lori Toma; right, Nancy Horsfall Couldwell) Cochrane, Alta., artist MJ Stead wanted to do what she could during the pandemic to help keep children occupied and inspired. She created a Facebook group called Paint with MJ and every weekday, Stead does a free, hour-long, Facebook Live painting class for kids. Stead expected 20 to 30 kids to sign up for the live painting class, but now her group has more than 1,500 members from all over the country — and many families have more than one child participating. Stead was inspired after painting helped her get through "a nasty cancer." Two years ago, Stead was diagnosed with breast cancer, which involved chemo, radiation and a double mastectomy. Stead said art got her through the treatments; when she couldn't get off the sofa, she challenged herself to do a painting a day for 100 days. "My breast cancer and my treatment brought me to a place where everybody else is right now — a place of uncertainty, of being isolated. I had no immune system," she said. "When school was cancelled, I knew how everybody was going to feel and that prompted me to get moving."
